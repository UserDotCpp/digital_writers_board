# The Origins of the Save The Cat Beat Sheet

The creator of the Save the Cat story structure is Blake Snyder, a speculative screenwriter. His credits include the movie “Blank Check “(1994) and five episodes of the television series “Kids Incorporated” (1993).

The Save The Cat template was first published in Snyder's best-selling Save the Cat (2005) guide to plotting dramatic structure. It is currently in its 34th printing.

Snyder's Save The Cat framework gets its name from the movie “Aliens” (1986). In the film, the audience is incited emotionally, when Officer Ripley's cat disappears. The audience anticipates that the cat may be the prey of a vicious extraterrestrial that is aboard her spaceship. It plays with the idea that if you show your character doing something that makes the audience root for them (such as saving a cat), then the audience will be instantly more invested in those characters.
What is The Blake Snyder Beat Sheet?

The Blake Snyder Beat Sheet is an elaboration of the classic 3 act story structure. If diagrammed, this story structure resembles a skewed pyramid, with an exposition, an upward path, a climax, a downward path and a conclusion.

These narratives are always character driven with a hero or anti-hero whose mission or adventure is blocked by an antagonistic force. The Midpoint of the story is always the point at which a big plot twist is revealed and the hero realizes they are, for better or worse, in a fight for their life. The second half of the story leads to a final scene, that is either a victory or catastrophe for the lead character.

The Save The Cat Beat Sheet was created by Snyder to help writers learn scene timing, as well as the placement of essential plot points such as an inciting incident, a life changing event, or the a false defeat of an antagonistic force.

A Quick Summary of Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet

The Save the Cat Beat Sheet is a popular story structure template created by Blake Snyder. Here's a brief overview of each of its 15 steps:

    Opening Image (1% of the script): This is the first impression of what kind of story the audience is about to see. It's a snapshot of the main character's problem before the adventure begins.
    Theme Stated (5%): The theme of the story is subtly suggested, often in a conversation.
    Set-Up (1-10%): This section provides more information about the hero's life as it currently is and what's missing from it.
    Catalyst (10%): A problem disrupts the hero's life, also known as the “call to adventure”.
    Debate (10-20%): The hero doubts the journey they must undertake. It's a last chance for the hero to say “No”.
    Break into Two (20%): The hero makes the decision and enters a new world or way of life.
    B Story (22%): A secondary story begins, often involving a love interest or a sidekick, that will weave in and out of the main story. It often carries the theme of the story.
    Fun and Games (20-50%): This is often where most of the trailer moments are found. The hero explores the new world and the audience is entertained.
    Midpoint (50%): A moment of either success or failure that changes the hero's journey in a meaningful way.
    Bad Guys Close In (50-75%): If the midpoint was a high, things get bad here. If the midpoint was a low, things start to look up.
    All is Lost (75%): The lowest point for the hero. The journey seems impossible to complete, and the hero feels defeated.
    Dark Night of the Soul (75-80%): The hero hits rock bottom, wallowing in hopelessness. The hero learns the theme stated back at the beginning.
    Break into Three (80%): The hero finds inspiration, often from the B Story, and decides it's time to fight.
    Finale (80-99%): The hero confronts the antagonist or whatever stands in their way. The lessons learned in Act Two are put into action.
    Final Image (99-100%): A reflection of the opening image, showing how the hero's world and character have changed.
